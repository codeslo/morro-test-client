## Contact Search
Given a list of contacts, create a function, **contactSearch**, that takes two parameters, a first name and a last name. If the contact list contains a match for both first and last name, return an object that contains all contact information for that entry. If the contactList does not contain a match for the search parameters, it should return the string 'no contact found'.

#### Requirements
* contactSearch returns an object literal
* the returns object has the same properties as the contactList object
* contactSearch should return the *correct* object, based on the search parameters
* contactSearch should return 'no contact found' if contactList does not contain a match
* *Note, no punctuation in 'no contact found'*
