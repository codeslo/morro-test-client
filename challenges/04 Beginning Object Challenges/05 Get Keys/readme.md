## Get Keys

Create a function `getKeys` that must accept an object literal as a parameter and should return an array containing the names of the keys from the parameter object.

#### Requirements
* `getKeys` should take an object as a parameter
* `getKeys` should return an array of the keys of the parameter object

```javascript
/*
This function should return an array. Use Array.push to
add the object keys to your result array. It doesn't
matter what order the keys are added to the array.
*/
```
