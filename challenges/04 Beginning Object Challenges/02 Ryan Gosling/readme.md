## Ryan Gosling
This challenge will test your ability to create a JavaScript object literal with properly formatted properties.

Create a function `makeGosling` that returns an object literal with the following properties and values:
  firstName = "Ryan"
  lastName = "Gosling"
  occupation = "Actor"
  catchPhrase = "Hey girl, I'll store your key/value pairs."

```javascript
/*
Object properties are stored in the format of key:value
and are separated by commas.
*/
```
