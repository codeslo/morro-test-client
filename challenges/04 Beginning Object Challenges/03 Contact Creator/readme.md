## Contact Creator

Create a function `contactCreator` that must accept three string parameters. The first will be a contact's first name. The second will be a contact's last name. The third will be a phone number.

`contactCreator` should return an object literal with the following properties:
  firstName
  lastName
  phoneNumber
    
The values of the properties should be drawn from the appropriate parameters.

```javascript
/*
Object properties are stored in the format of key:value
and are separated by commas.
*/
```
