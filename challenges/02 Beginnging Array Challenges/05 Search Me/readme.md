## Search Me
Create a function, **searchMe**, that takes two parameters. The first will be an array, the second will be a value to search for. If the array contains the search value, return the index position it was found at. Otherwise, return -1.

#### Requirements
* searchMe should accept two parameters. You may assume the first will be an array and the second will be a datatype such as a string or number.
* If the array contains a value equal to the second parameter, searchMe should return the index position it was found at.
* Otherwise, searchMe should return -1.
