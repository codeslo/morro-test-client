## Array Builder

#### Description
Create a function called **arrayBuilder** that returns an array. The array must be five elements long and the element at array position 2 should be 'CodeSLO'.

*Remember: array indices start at zero.*

#### Requirements
* arrayBuilder returns an array
* the array has a length of five
* array[2] is equal to 'CodeSLO'

```javascript
// Hint
['I','Like','CodeSLO']// would work if it had two extra elements in it

['I','Really','Think','CodeSLO','Is','Annoying'] //would not work... 
//...but not because our feelings would be hurt...
//...even though they would be. 
// Can you see what the problem would be? 
```
